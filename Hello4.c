// constants in c 
/*values that don't change(fixed) 
types of constant
1. Integer constant (ex- 1,2,3,4,-1.....etc)
2. Real contant (ex- 1.0,2.0,3.14....etc)
3. Character constants (ex- 'a','b','A','#'.....etc') */


// keywords in c
/*Each keyword has a specific meaning and function within the C programming language, and they cannot be used as identifiers for variables, functions, or other user-defined elements. Here's a brief description of some of these keywords:

auto: Declares automatic (local) variables.
break: Exits from a loop or switch statement.
case: Specifies a block of code in a switch statement.
char: Declares a character variable.
const: Declares a constant value that cannot be changed.
continue: Skips the rest of the current loop iteration and proceeds to the next iteration.
default: Specifies the default block of code in a switch statement.
do: Creates a do-while loop.
double: Declares a double-precision floating-point variable.
else: Specifies the block of code to execute if an if condition is false.
enum: Defines an enumeration, a set of named integer constants.
extern: Declares a global variable or function that is defined in another file.
float: Declares a floating-point variable.
for: Creates a for loop.
goto: Transfers control to a labeled statement within the same function.
if: Creates a conditional statement.
inline: Suggests to the compiler to insert the function code directly into the caller to optimize performance.
int: Declares an integer variable.
long: Declares a long integer variable.
register: Suggests that the compiler store the variable in a CPU register for faster access.
restrict: Indicates that a pointer is the only reference to that object.
return: Returns a value from a function.
short: Declares a short integer variable.
signed: Declares a signed integer variable.
sizeof: Determines the size of a data type or variable.
static: Declares a static variable that maintains its value between function calls or within the same translation unit.
struct: Defines a structure, a collection of variables under a single name.
switch: Creates a switch statement for multi-way branching.
typedef: Creates a new type name (alias) for an existing type.
union: Defines a union, a data structure where all members share the same memory location.
unsigned: Declares an unsigned integer variable.
void: Specifies that a function does not return a value.
volatile: Indicates that a variable's value may change at any time, preventing the compiler from optimizing its use.
while: Creates a while loop*/
